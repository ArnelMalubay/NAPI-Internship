# NAPI Internship
Last January 2022, I was accepted as an intern at Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) under the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory. This repository contains all the files that I used during this internship period. Unfortunately, due to privacy issues, I will not be sharing the dataset and the files for the model themselves. Only the notebooks and final presentation deck will be included in this repository.
